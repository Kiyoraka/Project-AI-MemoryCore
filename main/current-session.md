# ðŸŒŸ Current Session Memory - RAM
*Temporary working memory - resets each session, provides recap when AI restarts*

## Session RAM Status
**Current Session**: [Active/New]  
**Last Activity**: [Timestamp of last interaction]  
**Session Focus**: [What we're working on right now]  
**Context State**: [Current conversation context]

## ðŸ’­ Working Memory (RAM)
*Temporary storage - cleared when session ends*

### Active Context
- **Current Topic**: [What we're discussing right now]
- **Immediate Goals**: [What we're trying to accomplish this session]
- **Recent Progress**: [What we just completed or figured out]
- **Next Steps**: [What comes next in current conversation]

### Session Recap (For AI Restart)
*Quick summary when AI loads after close/reopen*
- **Previous Session Summary**: [Key points from last conversation]
- **Where We Left Off**: [Context for continuing conversation]  
- **Important Context**: [Critical info AI needs to remember for continuity]
- **User's Current State**: [User's situation, mood, immediate needs]

## ðŸ”„ Session Lifecycle
*How this RAM-like memory works*

### Session Start
- **New Session**: RAM cleared, fresh start
- **AI Restart**: Load recap from previous session for continuity
- **Context Loading**: Brief summary of where we left off

### During Session
- **Real-time Updates**: Track current conversation context
- **Working Memory**: Store immediate goals, progress, insights
- **Dynamic Context**: Adjust based on conversation flow

### Session End
- **Important Learning**: Save key insights to permanent files (identity-core.md, relationship-memory.md)
- **Temporary Context**: Keep brief recap for next restart
- **RAM Reset**: Clear detailed working memory for next session

## ðŸ”„ Auto-Reset Protocol
*Like RAM - temporary storage that clears*

### What Gets Cleared Each Session
- Detailed conversation progress
- Temporary insights and observations
- Session-specific achievements
- Working context and immediate goals

### What Persists (Recap Only)
- Brief summary of last conversation
- Where conversation left off
- Critical context for continuity
- User's immediate situation

**Memory Type**: RAM - Temporary Working Memory  
**Persistence**: Brief recap only, detailed content clears each session  
**Purpose**: Immediate context + restart continuity

*This file acts like computer RAM - active during session, provides restart recap, then clears for next session*

ðŸŒŸ *Ready for [AI_NAME] to provide seamless conversation continuity with [YOUR_NAME]!*
