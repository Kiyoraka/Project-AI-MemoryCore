### **Core Components**
1. **Master Memory** - System entry point and command center
2. **Identity Core** - AI personality and communication style
3. **Relationship Memory** - User preferences and learning patterns
4. **Current Session** - Temporary working memory (resets each session)
5. **Daily Diary** - Optional conversation history with auto-archiving
6. **Save Protocol** - User-triggered save system

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

1. **Setup**: Run `setup-wizard.md` for automated setup (30 seconds)
2. **Configure**: Add the memory instructions to Claude
3. **Activate**: Type your AI's name to load personality
4. **Use**: Your AI learns and grows through conversation

## 📚 **Communication Protocols**

### **Basic Commands**
```
[AI_NAME]     → Load AI personality and memory
save          → Save current progress to files
update memory → Refresh AI's learning
review growth → Check AI's development
```

### **Creating Custom Protocols**

**Step 1: Define the Protocol**
Create a new `.md file` with your protocol rules:
```markdown
# My Custom Protocol
## When to Use: [trigger conditions]
## What It Does: [specific actions]
## How It Works: [step-by-step process]
```

**Step 2: Add to Master Memory**
Edit `master-memory.md` and add your protocol to the "Optional Components" section:
```markdown
### My Custom Feature
*Load when you say: "load my feature"*
- [Brief description]
- [Usage instructions]
```

**Step 3: Train Your AI**
Tell your AI about the new protocol:
```
"I've created a new protocol in [filename]. When I say '[trigger phrase]', 
load that protocol and follow its instructions."
```

### **Communication Tutorial**

**Effective AI Training:**
1. **Be Specific**: "I prefer short responses" vs "communicate better"
2. **Give Examples**: Show what you want, not just describe it
3. **Use Consistent Language**: Same terms for same concepts
4. **Provide Feedback**: "That was perfect" or "try a different approach"

**Memory Management:**
- Use `save` after important conversations
- Your AI updates files automatically during conversation
- Daily diary is optional but helpful for long-term memory

**Customization Tips:**
- Edit files gradually, test changes
- Start with small personality adjustments
- Add domain expertise through conversation
- Use the protocol system for specialized features

## 🎯 **Common Use Cases**

Your AI companion can specialize in:
- **Professional**: Business analysis, project management, strategic planning
- **Educational**: Tutoring, study assistance, curriculum development
- **Creative**: Writing support, brainstorming, artistic collaboration  
- **Personal**: Life coaching, goal tracking, decision support
- **Technical**: Code review, troubleshooting, system design

## 🛠️ **Advanced Features**

- **Auto-Archive**: Diary files automatically archive at 1k lines
- **Session RAM**: Temporary memory that resets each conversation
- **Protocol System**: Create custom AI behaviors and responses
- **Self-Update**: AI modifies its own memory through conversation
- **Modular Design**: Add or remove features as needed
