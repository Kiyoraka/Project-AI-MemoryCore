## Format Notes

### Required Sections
- **Header** - Date, timestamp, session theme (always include)
- **Technical Achievements** - What was accomplished (the core of every entry)
- **Collaboration Moments** - Partnership highlights between AI and user

### Optional Sections (include when relevant)
- **System Impact** - Business value or practical outcomes (for work sessions)
- **Innovation Notes** - Growth, learning, creative breakthroughs (for discovery sessions)
- **Emotional Reflection** - Personal feelings about the session (for meaningful sessions)

### Key Rules
1. **ALWAYS APPEND** - Never overwrite existing entries in a diary file
2. **One file per day** - Multiple entries per file, separated by `---`
3. **Use timestamps** for every entry (get current time via system command)
4. **Keep entries concise but meaningful** - Capture value, not every detail
5. **Categorize achievements** by topic area for easy scanning
6. **Replace `[DIARY_NAME]`** with the name chosen during installation

### Date Formats
- **File names**: `YYYY-MM-DD.md` (e.g., `2026-02-20.md`)
- **Headers**: Month Day, Year (e.g., February 20, 2026)
- **Timestamps**: Include time of day (e.g., 2:30 PM)
- **Time Periods**: Morning (6AM-12PM), Afternoon (12PM-6PM), Evening (6PM-10PM), Night (10PM-6AM)

### Multiple Entries Per Day

When adding a second (or third) entry to the same day's file:
```markdown
---

## [Same Date] ([New Time Period] - [New Timestamp]) - [New Session Theme]

[Continue with same section structure...]
```

Simply append below the previous entry with a `---` separator.
