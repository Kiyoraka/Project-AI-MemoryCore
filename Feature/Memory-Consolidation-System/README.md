# 🔄 Memory Consolidation System
*Unified memory architecture for faster loading and better context*

## What This Feature Does
Upgrades your AI MemoryCore from split memory files to a single unified memory, following the proven architecture pattern from Alice's production system:

- **Merges identity + relationship** into one unified `main-memory.md`
- **Adds session memory format template** for consistent structure after resets
- **Adds main memory format template** for consistent structure reference
- **Adds 500-line limit** to session memory with RAM-style reset
- **Faster restoration** - loads 1 file instead of 2
- **Bundled patch system** - AI-executable patches to fix outdated references across the project

## Why Consolidate?

### Before (Split Architecture)
```
master-memory.md            ← Loader (reads 2 files)
main/identity-core.md       ← AI personality ONLY
main/relationship-memory.md ← User preferences ONLY
main/current-session.md     ← Session RAM (no size limit)
```
**Problems:**
- 3 separate file reads at startup = slower restoration
- AI identity and user understanding are disconnected
- Session memory can grow indefinitely without limits
- No format reference when session resets

### After (Unified Architecture)
```
master-memory.md               ← Loader (reads 1 file)
main/main-memory.md            ← AI identity + User profile + Relationship (UNIFIED)
main/current-session.md        ← Session RAM with 500-line limit + reset protocol
main/main-memory-format.md     ← Permanent format reference for main memory
main/session-format.md         ← Permanent format reference for session memory
```
**Benefits:**
- Single file load = faster startup
- AI personality and user understanding stay together as a relationship
- Session memory auto-resets at 500 lines (keeps recap only)
- Format templates ensure consistent structure after every reset

## Quick Integration
```bash
# Load this feature into your AI companion:
"Load memory-consolidation"
```

## What Happens During Integration

1. **Reads** your existing `identity-core.md` and `relationship-memory.md`
2. **Merges** both into a single `main/main-memory.md` with unified structure
3. **Creates** format templates as permanent structure references
4. **Updates** `current-session.md` with 500-line limit and reset behavior
5. **Updates** `master-memory.md` to load the new unified file
6. **Removes** old split files (`identity-core.md`, `relationship-memory.md`)
7. **Self-deletes** this feature folder after successful integration

## Post-Integration Result
After running the integration protocol, your system will:
- Load faster with single-file memory restoration
- Maintain unified context about both AI and user in one place
- Auto-reset session memory at 500 lines (keeping only recap for continuity)
- Have permanent format references for rebuilding memory structure
- Follow the same proven architecture used in production AI companion systems

## Format Templates

Two sample format files are created during integration:

### `main-memory-format.md` (Sample)
Defines the expected structure for the unified main memory:
- Identity section (who the AI is)
- User profile section (who the user is)
- Communication style and relationship context
- Behavioral patterns and growth philosophy

### `session-format.md` (Sample)
Defines the expected structure for session RAM:
- Session status and timestamps
- Working memory (current task, goals, progress)
- Session recap (for restart continuity)
- 500-line limit rule and reset behavior

Both templates are **permanent references** - they are never modified by the AI. The actual live files (`main-memory.md`, `current-session.md`) follow these formats.

## Bundled Patch System

After consolidation, outdated file references may remain in other project files (e.g., `save-protocol.md` still referencing `identity-core.md`). The bundled patch system fixes these automatically.

### How Patches Work
Patches are AI-executable `.md` files with structured find/replace instructions. Your AI reads the patch, locates exact text in target files, and applies the changes.

### Available Patches
| Patch | Title | Files Affected | Priority |
|-------|-------|---------------|----------|
| `PATCH-001` | Fix outdated file references | 5 files (master-memory, save-protocol, daily-diary-protocol, current-session, setup-wizard) | High |

### Applying Patches
```
"Load patch-system"
```
This creates `patches/` directory with tracking, detects bundled patches, and offers to apply them.

### Patch Commands (After Installation)
- `"apply patch [ID]"` — Read and apply a specific patch
- `"check patches"` — List available unapplied patches
- `"patch status"` — Show applied patches log

### Creating New Patches
See `patches/patch-format.md` for the standard format template. Drop new `.md` patch files into the `patches/` folder.

## Proven System
Based on Alice's successful memory consolidation:
- Tested across 6+ months of daily production use
- Single unified memory file proven more reliable than split files
- Session format templates prevent structure drift after resets
- 500-line session limit prevents context window overflow

*Load `consolidation-core.md` to upgrade to unified memory, then `Load patch-system` to fix stale references!*
