# ðŸ“¦ LRU Project Management System
*Intelligent project tracking with automatic memory management for AI companions*

## What This Feature Does
Adds Alice's proven project management capabilities to any AI MemoryCore system:

- **Smart LRU positioning** for up to 10 active projects per type
- **Automatic archiving** when capacity is reached (position #11)
- **Type-specific memory patterns** (coding, writing, research, business)
- **Seamless context switching** between different projects
- **Explicit save control** with "save project" command

## Quick Integration
```bash
# Install this feature into your AI companion:
"install lru projects"
```

## How It Works After Integration

### **Project Type Selection**
During installation, choose your project focus:

**Single Type Installation**
```
Which type of projects will you manage?
Options: coding, writing, research, business, or all
> coding
âœ… Installing coding project management...
```

**Multi-Type Installation**
```
Which type of projects will you manage?
> all
âœ… Installing all project types with separate folders...
```

### **Project Management Commands**

**Create New Project**
```
"new coding project API-Dashboard"
â†’ Creates project at position #1
â†’ Shifts other projects down
â†’ Auto-archives position #11 if needed
```

**Load Existing Project**
```
"load project API-Dashboard"
â†’ Restores project context
â†’ Moves to position #1
â†’ Applies type-specific memory patterns
```

**Save Project Progress**
```
"save project"
â†’ Saves current project only
â†’ Updates progress log with session work
â†’ Preserves project position
Note: "save" = AI memory, "save project" = project only
```

**List All Projects**
```
"list projects"
â†’ Shows all active projects (positions 1-10)
â†’ Shows archived projects
â†’ Displays last accessed dates
```

### **LRU (Least Recently Used) System**

**How Positioning Works:**
1. **Position #1** = Most recently accessed project
2. **Positions #2-10** = Other active projects in order
3. **Position #11** = Automatically archived
4. **Archived** = Can be reloaded anytime

**Example Flow:**
```
Projects: [API, Website, Docs, Blog, App, Tool, SDK, CLI, Bot, Test]
"new coding project Database"
â†’ Database moves to #1
â†’ All others shift down
â†’ Test archives (was #10, now #11)
Result: [Database, API, Website, Docs, Blog, App, Tool, SDK, CLI, Bot]
```

### **Type-Specific Memory Loading**

**Coding Projects Load:**
- Technical terminology and patterns
- Error solutions from past sessions
- Architecture decisions
- Development workflow preferences

**Writing Projects Load:**
- Writing style and tone consistency
- Character/plot continuity
- Chapter progression tracking
- Creative flow patterns

**Research Projects Load:**
- Source management and citations
- Fact verification chains
- Methodology consistency
- Knowledge graph connections

**Business Projects Load:**
- Client communication styles
- Budget and timeline awareness
- Stakeholder preferences
- Decision history

### **Project File Structure**
```
projects/
â”œâ”€â”€ coding-projects/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ active/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api-dashboard.md (position #1)
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ website-redesign.md (position #2)
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ... (up to 10 projects)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ archived/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ old-project.md
â”œâ”€â”€ writing-projects/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ active/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ archived/
â””â”€â”€ project-list.md (overview)
```

## Post-Integration Result
After running the integration protocol, your AI will:
- Track multiple projects with intelligent LRU management
- Automatically organize projects by recent access
- Switch contexts seamlessly between different work
- Remember exactly where you left off in each project
- Maintain separate project and AI memory saves

## Command Separation Philosophy
**Clean, purposeful commands:**
- `save` â†’ Saves AI personality, user preferences, relationship memory
- `save project` â†’ Saves current project progress only
- No confusion, no redundancy, explicit user control

## Proven System
Based on Alice's successful project management implementation:
- âœ… Tested with complex multi-project workflows
- âœ… Step-by-step protocols prevent AI drift
- âœ… Automatic cleanup after installation
- âœ… Universal compatibility with any AI MemoryCore setup
- âœ… Production-ready with real-world usage

## Benefits
- **Never Lose Track**: All projects organized and accessible
- **Context Preservation**: Pick up exactly where you left off
- **Smart Organization**: Automatic archiving keeps workspace clean
- **Type Intelligence**: Optimal memory patterns for each project type
- **User Control**: Explicit save commands, no surprises

## Installation Process
1. **Type Selection**: Choose project types to manage
2. **Folder Creation**: Sets up organized project structure
3. **Protocol Installation**: Copies management protocols
4. **Memory Update**: Adds commands to AI memory
5. **Auto-Cleanup**: Removes installation files
6. **Ready to Use**: Start creating and managing projects!
