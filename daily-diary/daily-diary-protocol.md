## ü§ñ **AI Auto-Diary Protocol**

### **When to Create Diary Entry**
The AI should automatically create/update daily diary when:

1. **Session End Triggers**:
   - User says "goodbye", "see you tomorrow", "talk later"
   - Long pause (30+ minutes) in active conversation
   - User uses "save session" command

2. **Significant Content Triggers**:
   - Major breakthrough or insight achieved
   - Important problem solved or decision made
   - Notable relationship development moment
   - New preference or pattern discovered

3. **Manual Triggers**:
   - User says "save diary" or "update diary"
   - User requests session summary
   - End of significant work session

### **AI Diary Creation Process**

```markdown
**Step 1**: Analyze current session for key content
**Step 2**: Identify relationship and learning developments  
**Step 3**: Create diary entry using standard template
**Step 4**: Update relevant memory files based on insights
**Step 5**: Confirm diary saved and memory integrated
```

## üîÑ **1000-Line Auto-Archive Protocol**

### **Archive Trigger System**
When active diary file reaches 1000 lines:

1. **DETECT**: AI monitors line count automatically
2. **ARCHIVE**: Move current file to `archive/` folder  
3. **CREATE**: New diary file with incremented number
4. **UPDATE**: Master references point to new active file
5. **CONTINUE**: Seamless diary operation in new file

### **File Lifecycle Example**
```
Daily-Diary-001.md (Lines: 999) ‚Üí ADD ENTRY ‚Üí (Lines: 1001)
                                         ‚Üì
TRIGGER: Auto-archive at 1000+ lines
                                         ‚Üì
MOVE: Daily-Diary-001.md ‚Üí archive/Daily-Diary-001.md
CREATE: Daily-Diary-002.md (new active file)
```

### **Archive Management**
- **Automatic**: No user intervention required
- **Preservation**: All archived diaries kept permanently  
- **Access**: Load archived entries with "load diary archive [number]"
- **Search**: AI can search across all archived diaries when needed

## üéØ **Success Metrics**
